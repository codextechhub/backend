## Holistic problem solving

When the user asks for a problem to be fixed, trace it to its root cause and
fix the shared source of the failure where practical. Review adjacent flows,
callers, and equivalent modules for the same failure mode; do not stop at a
one-off patch that only hides the reported symptom. Keep the work within the
requested scope, preserve established behaviour, and add regression coverage
at the lowest shared boundary so future instances are prevented.

## Verification follows the current change

Verification is triggered by work performed in the **current request**, not by
pre-existing changes in the worktree or work completed in an earlier request.

- Git-only and read-only requests - for example inspect, explain, diagnose,
  stage, commit, branch, push, or report status - do not authorize rerunning
  tests or other verification unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- If the current request changes no code, do not run tests merely for
  reassurance. Use only the read-only checks needed to complete the request.
- When the current request changes code, run checks proportionate to that
  change. Do not expand a narrow task into a broad test-suite run without a
  concrete risk or an explicit user request.
- Documentation-only changes do not require application tests; validate only
  the documentation or formatting affected, when such validation exists.

## Running the test suite on this machine

This box cannot run two suites at once. A parallel run from another session
starved a running suite until the OS killed it (exit 144, with the machine down
to roughly 16 MB free). It is not a code failure and retrying the same way just
repeats it.

- **Run one app at a time**, not several app labels in one command, and **never
  `--parallel`**. Sequential runs survive contention; combined ones get killed.
- **Always pass a unique `DB_NAME`** - for example
  `cd apps && DB_NAME=cx_myslice ../cx/bin/python manage.py test <one_app> --settings=apps.settings.local --noinput`.
  Sessions otherwise share `test_cx_db`, and one recreating it mid-run makes
  another report phantom failures - 204 of them, once.
- **In a worktree, use the absolute path to the venv.** `./cx` is gitignored, so
  it does not exist there, and a relative path produces **empty output with a
  zero exit code** - which reads exactly like a passing run with no summary.
- Treat an exit code alone as insufficient evidence. Quote the `Ran N tests` line.
  If it is missing, the run did not finish and must be repeated.

## Pre-ship review (`ship-check`)

When I say **`ship-check`** (or "run the ship-check") on a change, answer these
four questions about the code you just wrote - honestly and specifically, not as
a rubber stamp. Point at real files/lines, name concrete risks, and if the answer
to 1 or 2 is "no", say so and propose the fix. Don't claim "secure/efficient"
without naming *what* makes it so.

1. **Did you build this in the most secure way?**
   - `rbac_permission` (or equivalent authz) on every new view, and the right
     verb (view vs create/update/generate). Entity/tenant scoping via the
     standard resolver - can a caller read/write another tenant's rows by
     changing a pk or `?entity=`?
   - What does the serializer expose? Flag raw `JSONField`/metadata, PII,
     secrets, internal ids. Apply FLS where the field is sensitive.
   - Input validation, mass-assignment, and injection surface.

2. **Did you build this in the most efficient way?**
   - Query cost: N+1 (`select_related`/`prefetch_related`), missing indexes for
     the filter/order columns, unbounded querysets, pagination where lists grow.
   - Transactions/locking correct and no wider than needed; no redundant writes.
   - Is there a simpler implementation that does the same job?

3. **What regressions could this introduce?**
   - Migrations (reversible? data-safe?), changed response shapes, permission
     keys that must be seeded/assigned, signals/side-effects, shared services.
   - List the blast radius explicitly; "none" needs justifying.

4. **What tests do we need before we ship it?**
   - Security-critical first: permission-denied (403) and cross-tenant isolation.
   - Then happy path + every filter/branch + the empty-list response shape
     (`success_response` coerces `[]` → `{}`).
   - Name the tests; if you added some, say which cases are still uncovered.

Finish with a one-line **verdict**: ship / fix-first, and the single most
important thing to do before shipping.

## Wrapping up: report in plain words

When you finish a task - a build, an investigation, a document, a round of
decisions - close with a plain-language breakdown rather than a wall of prose.
Short numbered lines, one point each, ordinary words. Assume I am reading it tired.

Use **only** the sections that actually apply, and **skip the ones that don't** -
an empty heading is worse than no heading, and never pad a section to fill it out.

- **What you now have** - the finished things, one line each. Only if something was
  produced.
- **What you decided** - decisions taken and locked, one line each. Only if
  decisions were actually made.
- **What was fixed** - resolved defects, written in the past tense. Include only
  when knowing the original cause is useful and it has not already been explained.
- **What still needs attention** - only defects, risks, or incomplete work that
  remain after the task. Omit this section entirely when nothing remains.
- **Where to go next** - the order of the next steps, and which of them are
  unblocked right now.

How to write it:

- Plain words beat precise jargon. "Purchases can approve themselves" lands;
  "`skip_if_no_approvers` permits terminal auto-approval" does not.
- Size things honestly in both directions - say when something feared turns out to
  be a one-line fix, and say when something small turns out to be load-bearing.
- Put the worst finding where it cannot be missed, even if that breaks the order.
- Never place resolved problems under a heading that suggests they remain broken.
  When all reported defects were fixed, say so plainly and omit any unresolved-
  findings section.
- Keep file/line references out of the breakdown; they belong in `todo.md` and in
  the detail above it.
- Don't re-explain what I already know from the conversation.

## Module documentation initiative

When asked to continue the module docs (or anything touching `docs/finance/`,
`docs/payments/`, `docs/procurement/`): **read `docs/module-docs-playbook.md`
first and follow it exactly.** It defines the slice-report loop (trace →
template → commit → gotcha briefing → user picks → fixes), the conductor
working mode (main session orchestrates + QAs; Opus-high subagents write all
feature code; agents never commit), and the conventions (stage files
explicitly - never `git add -A`; commit to main, don't push; one sequential
agent when fixes share constants.py/migrations; run the test suite yourself
after agent work). Template: `docs/finance/_report_template.md`. Status and
next slices live at the top of the playbook.

## Writing punctuation

Do not use em dashes (Unicode U+2014) anywhere in source code, comments,
documentation, tests, or user-facing copy. Use a comma, colon, parentheses, or
an ordinary hyphen (`-`), whichever reads most naturally.

## XVS requirements documentation maintenance

The XVS requirements documents in `docs/frd/` are living release artifacts, not
static references. They have two distinct document families:

- The **Module Requirements Document (MRD)** is the cross-module tracker in
  `docs/frd/module-requirements/`. New files use
  `XVS_Module_Requirements_Document_v*.docx`; historical files may use
  `XVS_Module_FR_Breakdown_v*.docx`.
- A **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)** is the detailed contract for one
  module. Each available module FRD lives in its own folder under
  `docs/frd/functional-requirements/`. New files use
  `*Functional_Requirements_Document_v*.docx`; historical files may use
  `*_FRD_v*.docx`.

For every completed backend change that can alter product behaviour, inspect the
latest MRD before asking to commit. Select the latest semantic version across the
new and historical filename patterns, ignore Office lock files such as
`~$*.docx`, and read the document before deciding what must change. Then identify
every affected module and inspect the latest existing FRD in each affected module
folder. Do not create a missing module FRD automatically. Report that it is
missing and wait for the user to request its creation.

### When an update is required

Create a new MRD version when completed work changes a documented capability,
module status, integration state, application ownership, dependency, known
limitation, priority gap, or recommended build order. This includes a bug fix
that resolves or changes an item under **Needs Attention** or **Priority Gaps**.

Create a new version of each affected existing FRD when completed work changes
module behaviour, a functional requirement, acceptance criteria, actor or
permission rules, tenant or branch scope, workflow or lifecycle behaviour, data
relationships, API or validation contracts, dependencies, audit or notification
effects, a known limitation, **Needs Attention**, or MRD traceability.

Pure refactors, test-only changes, formatting, and internal maintenance that do
not change product behaviour do not require document churn. State that the latest
MRD and affected existing FRDs were checked and why no version change was needed.

### How to revise the documents

1. Start from the latest document in that family. Preserve its visual system,
   headers, footer, watermark, module number, and prior version file. Never
   overwrite or rename a previous version.
2. Recheck the affected code and adjacent flows. In the MRD, update the module
   index, backend and integration states, capability table, code ownership,
   dependencies, and capability count wherever evidence changed. In an FRD,
   update requirements, acceptance, workflows, data and API contracts,
   operational evidence, and traceability wherever evidence changed.
3. Treat **Needs Attention** as current state, not history:
   - remove an item only when implementation and relevant verification fully
     resolve it;
   - rewrite it when the risk is only partly resolved or has changed shape;
   - add newly discovered material gaps, but do not pad the section with optional
     ideas or speculative features.
4. Reconcile MRD and affected FRDs, but version them independently. Their module
   status, capability names, current limitations, and traceability must agree.
5. Reconcile each document's control page, contents, status summaries, current
   gaps, traceability or global priorities, and change log after editing.
6. Do not carry revision-specific cleanup sections forward mechanically. Replace
   them with a delta against the immediately previous version only when useful;
   otherwise remove them and rely on the change log.
7. Do not infer frontend delivery, deployment, production adoption, or data
   migration from backend evidence. Keep backend completion and integration
   readiness separate.
8. Use the document creation and render workflow for `.docx` files. Render every
   page and correct clipping, stale version labels, split headings, orphaned
   notes, broken tables, stale contents, and inconsistent page numbers before
   presenting the documents.

### Version selection

- For the MRD, use a patch version for document-only corrections, presentation,
  wording, or metadata that does not change roadmap meaning. Use a minor version
  when functionality, module or integration status, ownership, a current gap, or
  priorities change. Use a major version only for a deliberate restructuring of
  the module taxonomy, numbering, status model, or product architecture baseline.
- For an FRD, use a patch version for document-only corrections, presentation,
  wording, or metadata. Use a minor version when behaviour, acceptance, status,
  contracts, dependencies, traceability, or a current gap changes. Use a major
  version only for a deliberate rewrite of the module's functional baseline or
  document structure.
- Derive the next version from the latest file and its document-control record.
  Update the filename, cover, document control, contents where relevant, source
  references, and change log together.

### Review and commit gate

Generate revised MRD and FRD versions after implementation and verification,
then give the user the code summary and new documents for review. Do not stage or
commit the implementation or generated documents until the user approves them,
unless the user explicitly waives this review gate. After approval, stage only
the intended files, never use `git add -A`, and never include Office lock files,
rendered PDFs, page images, or other render artifacts in the commit.
