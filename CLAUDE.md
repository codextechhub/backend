## What this codebase is - and what XVS is

**This repo is a multi-domain platform, not a schools application.** The engine
apps - `vs_finance`, `vs_procurement`, `vs_payments`, `vs_rbac`, `vs_workflow`,
`vs_notifications`, `vs_audit`, `core` - are deliberately **domain-neutral**. They
know about entities, customers, invoices, vendors, roles and approvals; they know
nothing about schools. `vs_health` (VIGIL) is already a second domain standing on
the same foundation, and there will be more.

**XVS is the first product built on that platform** - the schools product.

Two rules follow, and they are separate:

1. **Keep the engines domain-neutral.** School concepts - students, guardians,
   classes, terms, sessions - live in the school apps (`apps/schools/`) and reach
   the engines through the FAL (`core/fal/`). Never leak school vocabulary into
   `vs_finance` and friends. That leak is precisely what the FAL exists to
   prevent; if you find yourself adding a `student` or `term` field to a generic
   app, stop.
2. **Within XVS, build for every school, not the first one.** XVS is multi-tenant;
   Corona Secondary School (at `xvs.codexng.com`) is simply the first tenant.
   Nothing may be special-cased to one tenant's arrangement - if a feature only
   works because of how the first school happens to be set up, it isn't finished.
   **Branch-optional and multi-branch schools must both work**; where a school has
   no branches the dimension should *recede* (no empty column, no pointless
   filter), not show blank space. Test more than one shape of school - a
   single-tenant test proves nothing about tenancy.

## Pre-ship review (`ship-check`)

When I say **`ship-check`** (or "run the ship-check") on a change, answer these
four questions about the code you just wrote - honestly and specifically, not as
a rubber stamp. Point at real files/lines, name concrete risks, and if the answer
to 1 or 2 is "no", say so and propose the fix. Don't claim "secure/efficient"
without naming *what* makes it so.

1. **Did you build this in the most secure way?**
   - `rbac_permission` (or equivalent authz) on every new view, and the right
     verb (view vs create/update/generate). Entity/tenant scoping via the
     standard resolver - can a caller read/write another tenant's rows by
     changing a pk or `?entity=`?
   - What does the serializer expose? Flag raw `JSONField`/metadata, PII,
     secrets, internal ids. Apply FLS where the field is sensitive.
   - Input validation, mass-assignment, and injection surface.

2. **Did you build this in the most efficient way?**
   - Query cost: N+1 (`select_related`/`prefetch_related`), missing indexes for
     the filter/order columns, unbounded querysets, pagination where lists grow.
   - Transactions/locking correct and no wider than needed; no redundant writes.
   - Is there a simpler implementation that does the same job?

3. **What regressions could this introduce?**
   - Migrations (reversible? data-safe?), changed response shapes, permission
     keys that must be seeded/assigned, signals/side-effects, shared services.
   - List the blast radius explicitly; "none" needs justifying.

4. **What tests do we need before we ship it?**
   - Security-critical first: permission-denied (403) and cross-tenant isolation.
   - Then happy path + every filter/branch + the empty-list response shape
     (`success_response` coerces `[]` → `{}`).
   - Name the tests; if you added some, say which cases are still uncovered.

Finish with a one-line **verdict**: ship / fix-first, and the single most
important thing to do before shipping.

## Wrapping up: report in plain words

When you finish a task - a build, an investigation, a document, a round of
decisions - close with a plain-language breakdown rather than a wall of prose.
Short numbered lines, one point each, ordinary words. Assume I am reading it tired.

Use **only** the sections that actually apply, and **skip the ones that don't** -
an empty heading is worse than no heading, and never pad a section to fill it out.

- **What you now have** - the finished things, one line each. Only if something was
  produced.
- **What you decided** - decisions taken and locked, one line each. Only if
  decisions were actually made.
- **What we found wrong in the code** - real defects and gaps, grouped under short
  themes once there are more than about four. **Only if there are findings** - if
  nothing is wrong, leave this out entirely rather than writing "nothing found".
- **Where to go next** - the order of the next steps, and which of them are
  unblocked right now.

How to write it:

- Plain words beat precise jargon. "Purchases can approve themselves" lands;
  "`skip_if_no_approvers` permits terminal auto-approval" does not.
- Size things honestly in both directions - say when something feared turns out to
  be a one-line fix, and say when something small turns out to be load-bearing.
- Put the worst finding where it cannot be missed, even if that breaks the order.
- Keep file/line references out of the breakdown; they belong in `todo.md` and in
  the detail above it.
- Don't re-explain what I already know from the conversation.

## Module documentation initiative

When asked to continue the module docs (or anything touching `docs/finance/`,
`docs/payments/`, `docs/procurement/`): **read `docs/module-docs-playbook.md`
first and follow it exactly.** It defines the slice-report loop (trace →
template → commit → gotcha briefing → user picks → fixes), the conductor
working mode (main session orchestrates + QAs; Opus-high subagents write all
feature code; agents never commit), and the conventions (stage files
explicitly - never `git add -A`; commit to main, don't push; one sequential
agent when fixes share constants.py/migrations; run the test suite yourself
after agent work). Template: `docs/finance/_report_template.md`. Status and
next slices live at the top of the playbook.

## Fixing problems: root cause, not symptom

When I ask you to fix a problem, treat the reported issue as one *instance* of
a potentially wider defect - fix it holistically:

1. **Trace it to its source.** Ask why the bug exists - a wrong assumption, a
   missing invariant, a fragile pattern - not just where it surfaced.
2. **Fix the class, not the case.** If the same root cause can bite elsewhere
   (other views, serializers, services, callers of the same helper), fix it at
   the choke point they all share, or sweep the other occurrences in the same
   change.
3. **Name the root.** In the summary/commit, state the underlying cause and
   where else it applied, so the fix is reviewable as a class-fix, not a patch.

A fix that only silences the reported symptom while the source remains is not
done - that includes suppressing errors, special-casing one caller, or adding
a guard where the real problem is upstream. The goal is that future problems
from the same source never happen.

## Writing punctuation

Do not use em dashes (Unicode U+2014) anywhere in source code, comments,
documentation, tests, or user-facing copy. Use a comma, colon, parentheses, or
an ordinary hyphen (`-`), whichever reads most naturally.
